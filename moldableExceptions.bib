Traditional object inspectors favor a generic view that focuses on the low-level details of the state of single objects. Based on 16 interviews with software developers and a follow-up survey with 62 respondents we identified a need for object inspectors that support different high-level ways to visualize and explore objects, depending on both the object and the current developer need. We propose the Moldable Inspector, a novel inspector model that enables developers to adapt the inspection workflow to suit their immediate needs by making the inspection context explicit, providing multiple interchangeable domain-specific views for each object, and supporting  a workflow that groups together multiple levels of connected objects. We show that the Moldable Inspector can address multiple kinds of development needs involving a wide range of objects.},

	abstract = {Understanding the run-time behavior of software systems can be a challenging activity. Debuggers are an essential category of tools used for this purpose as they give developers direct access to the running systems. Nevertheless, traditional debuggers rely on generic mechanisms to introspect and interact with the running systems, while developers reason about and formulate domain-specific questions using concepts and abstractions from their application domains. This mismatch creates an abstraction gap between the debugging needs and the debugging support leading to an inefficient and error-prone debugging effort, as developers need to recover concrete domain concepts using generic mechanisms. To reduce this gap, and increase the efficiency of the debugging process, we propose a framework for developing domain-specific debuggers, called the Moldable Debugger, that enables debugging at the level of the application domain. The Moldable Debugger is adapted to a domain by creating and combining domain-specific debugging operations with domain-specific debugging views, and adapts itself to a domain by selecting, at run time, appropriate debugging operations and views. To ensure the proposed model has practical applicability (i.e., can be used in practice to build real debuggers), we discuss, from both a performance and usability point of view, three implementation strategies. We further motivate the need for domain-specific debugging, identify a set of key requirements and show how our approach improves debugging by adapting the debugger to several domains.},

A common strategy employed by developers to deal with this reality is to perform exploratory investigations by means of searching.
Nevertheless, most integrated development environments (IDEs) support searching through generic and disconnected search tools.
This impedes search tasks over domain-specific entities as considerable effort is wasted by developers locating and linking data and concepts relevant to their application domains. To tackle this problem we propose Spotter, a moldable framework for supporting contextual-aware searching in IDEs by enabling developers to easily create custom searches for domain objects.  In this paper we motivate a set of requirements for Spotter and show, through usage scenarios, that Spotter improves program comprehension by reducing the effort required to find and search through concepts from a wide range of domains. Furthermore, we show that by taking code into account, Spotter can provide a single entry point for embedding search support within an IDE.},

To make informed decisions developers commonly formulate detailed and domain-specific questions about their software systems and  use tools to explore available information and answer those questions. Development tools however focus on generic programming tasks while program comprehension and analysis tools typically are not tightly integrated with their development tools and environments. This  has a negative effect on program comprehension as it increases the effort and the time needed to obtain an answer. To improve program comprehension we propose that developers build software using development tools tailored to their specific application domains, as this can directly answer domain-specific questions. We introduce moldable development as an approach for developing software in which developers evolve development tools together with their applications.  In this paper we sketch the idea of moldable development and give examples to illustrate how it can be applied in practice. Through these examples we show that given a low cost for extending development tools, developers can create relevant and useful customizations to help them evolve their own applications.},

Spotter is a code search engine for the Pharo programming language. Since its inception, Spotter has been rapidly and broadly adopted within the Pharo community. However, little is known about how practitioners employ Spotter to search and navigate within the Pharo code base. This paper evaluates how software engineers use Spotter in practice. To achieve this, we remotely gather user actions called events. These events are then visually rendered using an adequate navigation tool chain. Sequences of events are represented using a visual alphabet. We found a number of usage patterns and identified underused Spotter features. Such findings are essential for improving Spotter.},

This forces developers to spend considerable time manually linking disconnected search results.
